        <h3>
            Planet Treasure
        </h3>
    </li>
    <p>
        Man those were Disney movies, i don't know what happened after they started with live actions movies, they
        just
        went
        from bad to worst.

        Anyways, this is the story of a young boy that likes to surf around the world on a cohet skateboard that he
        made
        himself until something happens.

        A pirate ship with antigravity technology crashes into his house.

        A hurted man comes out of the ship just to die in the young Hopkins hands moments after.

        Not before to giving Hopkins a ball of gold.

        Ball that after Hopkins discover that is actually a tech Map that displays in hologram indications, the
        location
        of
        every planet in the Universe, including the ubication of the Planet Treasure.

        And you can just imagine, we will following through the journey, the history is marvelous, emotional,
        thoughful,
        but
        still full of pation, action and battles.

        I don't think the man have ever done anything so precious as this movie.

        I will wait forever Part II - (Or maybe i'll just do one myself He! ;)
